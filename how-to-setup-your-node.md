# How to setup your Node

Each sidechain will calculate its gas usage, as well as the validator participation rate. Businesses that want to run their own sidechain accordingly are required to deposit NET tokens in the sidechain contract. The gas consumed during the given notarization window will be cumulated per user and the corresponding amount of NET will be deducted from the deposit.

In case of Nordic Energy, foundation sidechains will go live with mainnet launch to run our use-cases. The entry barrier for validation of those sidechains is set at a minimum of 1.000 NET and a maximum of 500.000 NET. Depending on the amount of tokens staked and other variables that will be defined below, a network member can choose among 3 types of setups:

**/Node**

To join a sidechain of your choice and become a **Node,** the participant needs to:

*  Download and install the dedicated software on Linux
*  Run an active node for at least one notarization window on a compatible hardware\*
*  Stake a minimum of **1.000 NETs**
*  Reward Factor: **1**

Reward Distribution: Every certain number of blocks the network anchors to the mainnet and the transactions fees collected are split between all the active nodes, proportionally to the NETs owned with NPS and Trust nodes earning up to double \(see above\). Currently we’re synchronizing and therefore distributing staking rewards every ~720 blocks which is every hour, but this figure is subject to change depending on the use case. This is the so-called “notarization window”.

**/Trust Node**

To join a sidechain of your choice and become 

a **Trust Node,** the participant needs to:

*  Download and install the dedicated software on Linux
*  Run an active node for at least one notarization window on a compatible hardware\*
*  Stake a minimum of **50.000 NETs**
*  Reward Factor: **2**

Reward Distribution: a Trust Node’s weight is double as a normal Node, meaning that rewards are **doubled.** 

_/NPS \(Nordic Energy Pool Staking_

Shortly after our mainnet lunch, Nordic Energy will launch its NPS system.

To facilitate users with no tech expertise to join the network, Nordic Energy Foundation will run NPS Nodes on behalf of wallet owners that are willing to pool their NET tokens, in return for this service a little maintenance fee is hold by Nordic Energy for the costs to run a node.

Every user can choose for how long they are willing to lock their tokens into the pooling system. Depending on the time-commitment the rewards are higher or lower. The longer the lock-up period, the higher are the rewards and vice versa.

**The NPS have the following lock-up and reward factor options:**

**1 Month** = 1.2 Reward Factor  
 **3 Months** = 1.4 Reward Factor  
 **6 Months** = 1.6 Reward Factor  
 **12 Months** = 1.8 Reward Factor

**To join a sidechain of your choice and become a NPS Node, the participant needs to:**

*  Stake a minimum of **5.000 NETs**
*  Commit for at least 1 Month, up to 12 Moths. NET will be locked
*  Reward Factor: **1.2/1.4/1.6/1.8**– depending on the lock-ups
