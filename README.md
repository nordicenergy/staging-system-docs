description: A reward system to stimulate stake pools and community adoption

**Introduction**

As we are slowly but surely approaching Nordic Energyâ€™s PowerChain Mainnet launch, we felt the need to clarify once and for all the dynamics of staking Nordic Energy tokens as support to our consensus layer.

As stated in our White Paper, we are using a custom Nordic Energy Proof of Stake consensus algorithm \(NPoS\) which integrates the staking concept into the Byzantine fault tolerance \(BTF\) algorithm. Everyone is eligible to be part of the network of nodes which are needed to make sure that transactions or smart contract interactions are correctly propagated through the whole network. Everybody who possesses enough Nordic Energy multi-tokens and the required soft- and hardware can participate in the validation system.
