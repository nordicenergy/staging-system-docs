# Pooling \(Nordic Energy Pool Staking / NPS\)

The low entry barrier of 1000 NET is designed for easy set-up of sidechains enabling quick adoption for real-life use cases. It is also great for technical NET token holders that want to support adoption of our blockchain and provide their node for this.

However, many NET holders would like to stake their tokens, but do not want to operate a sidechain node and validate blocks. After all, this provides a stable internet connection and solid processing power, as outlined later in this article. For this, Nordic Energy is creating a pool in which NET token holders can transfer their tokens to, and benefit from higher staking rewards. To benefit from the pooling service, the user needs to commit for 1/3/6 or 12 Months. 

Depending on the commitments length staker will earn respectively x1.2/x1.4/x1.6 or x1.8 compered to a Normal Node. We believe this is the best solutions for NET token holders that want to support the blockchain with their tokens, but don’t want to have the technical hurdle of setting up and maintaining a network node. This is further detailed below in the “NPS” chapter.
